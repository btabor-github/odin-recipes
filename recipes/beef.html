   <ul>

           <p>
               Slice beef into very thin strips and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt, 
               pepper, and garlic powder.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>Step 2
           <p>

               with the remaning olive oil and beef.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>Step 3
           <p>
               Fill a large pot with water and set over high heat on another burner.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>Step 4
           <p>
               Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook 
               until it starts to release its juices, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon 
               salt; cook, stirring often, until tender and lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.  Sprinkle with 
               flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste and cook 
               for 1 minute.

       </li>
       <li>Step 5
           <p>
               Whisk in 2 cups beef broth and mustard and bring to a simmer, scraping the browned 
               bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add more broth if 
               necessary as sauce thickens.  Stir in Worcestershire sauce and add reserved beef 
               and any drippings.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, while you cook 
               the pasta.

               with remaining 1 tablespoon butter.

       </li>
       <li>Step 7
           <p>

               and adjust salt and pepper, if needed.
